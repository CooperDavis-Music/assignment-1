            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>Cooper Davis started his musical journey at the age of five when he began taking piano lessons. He soon discovered that his musical ambitions were in composition. At age 11, he began studying composition with Luke Marantz at Mark Murphy Music in South Orange, NJ. There he learned the basics of music theory, understanding music through the medium of a piano as a conduit for his creativity. At age 14, Cooper got his first laptop which sparked his passion for music production and recording music. He spent his high school years (and the long days of the COVID pandemic) developing his craft using Logic Pro and producing as much as he could through, eventually swapping to Ableton as his primary DAW. </p>
